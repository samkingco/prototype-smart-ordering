# Echo smart ordering prototype

> A prototype for the smart ordering project. Check out design progress in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/AWMzeaAyFAP5EjwEnjXIfS/Smart-ordering).

## Demo

You can see a version of this running on the public internet at [p0-echo-ordering.surge.sh](https://p0-echo-ordering.surge.sh/). It might not be the same version as in this repo.

_There's nothing sensitive, but it would be nice if it wasn't shared outside of Echo. Speak to @samkingco about publishing/unpublishing._

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
